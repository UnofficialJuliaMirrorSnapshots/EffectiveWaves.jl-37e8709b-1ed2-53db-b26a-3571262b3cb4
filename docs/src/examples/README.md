## [demo.jl](vary_two_species/README.md)
Shows how to choose two species, vary the volume fraction of them both, and plot the resulting sound speed and attenuation.

## [Calculate the many wavenumbers](many_wavenumbers/README.md)
 For each angular frequency Ï‰ there are a multitude of effective wavenumbers.

## [Demonstrate the matching method](matched_method/README.md)
Compare the matched method with a purely numerical scheme. Both of these methods calculate the ensemble average wave in a particulate material.

## [optimse_demo.jl](optimise_wavespeed/optimse_demo.jl)
Shows how to find the optimal species, given an objective function such as increase broadband attenuation.
