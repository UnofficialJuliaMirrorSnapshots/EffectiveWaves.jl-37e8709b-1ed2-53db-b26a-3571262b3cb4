# EffectiveWaves.jl Documentation

A Julia package for calculating, processing and plotting waves travelling in heterogeneous materials. The focus is on calculating the ensemble averaged waves, i.e. the statistical moments, of the waves.
You can run Julia on [JuliaBox](https://www.juliabox.com/) in your browser without installation.

At present, the packages calculates effective wavenumbers, wave transimission and wave reflection from random particulate materials, see [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05427) for some details on the mathematics, or [these notes](theory/WavesInMultiSpecies.pdf) for the formulas.

The package can deal with any volume fraction and frequency range.

!!! note
    First install Julia v1.0.0 or later, then run in the Julia REPL:
    ```julia
    using Pkg
    Pkg.add EffectiveWaves
    ```
    Alternatively, use the Julia package manager.
    From the Julia REPL, type `]` to enter the Pkg REPL mode and then run
    ```
    pkg> add EffectiveWaves
    ```

## Quick introduction

Here we calculate the effective wavenumbers for two species randomly (uniformly) distributed in Glycerol. We use only low volume fraction methods for simplicity.
```julia
using EffectiveWaves
#where: ρ = density, r = radius, c = wavespeed, and volfrac = volume fraction

const WaterDistilled= Medium(ρ=0.998*1000, c = 1496.0)
const Glycerol      = Medium(ρ=1.26*1000,  c = 1904.0)

species = [
    Specie(ρ=WaterDistilled.ρ,r=30.e-6, c=WaterDistilled.c, volfrac=0.1),
    Specie(ρ=Inf, r=100.0e-6, c=2.0, volfrac=0.2)
]
# background medium
background = Glycerol
```
For a list of other materials go to [examples/materials.jl](examples/materials.jl).

### Calculate effective wavenumbers:
```julia
# angular frequencies
ωs = LinRange(0.01,1.0,60)*30.0e6
ks = wavenumber_low_volfrac(ωs, background, species)

speeds = ωs ./ real.(ks)
attenuations = imag.(ks)
```
### Plot the results
```julia
using Plots
pyplot(linewidth=2.0)

p1 = plot(ωs, speeds, lab = "", ylabel = "wave speed (m/s)", xlabel = "frequency");
p2 = plot(ωs, attenuations, lab = "", ylabel = "attenuation (1/m)", xlabel = "frequency");
plot(p1,p2, layout = (2,1))
```
